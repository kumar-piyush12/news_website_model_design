        PayPal enables transfer of digital currencies to external wallets
      </h1>
      <img src={news1} className='articles--image' />
      <p className='articles--description'>
        The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy
        and sell crypto on its platform. <br />
        After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in
        October 2020, PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively
        transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other
        wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select
        U.S. users, with the feature expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the
        coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of Bitcoin.{' '}
        <br />
        <br />
        BTC $16,704, Ether ETH $1,217, Bitcoin Cash BCH $100, and Litecoin LTC
        $74.58. <br />
        <br />
        Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto
        section of the application to start transferring coins. Users are
        generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the
        procedure.In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal
        can spend it via Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The company
        has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of
        Financial Services for the conduct. <br />
        <br />
        Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network
        fee based on their respective blockchains, but transfers between PayPal
        users will not incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the firm
        generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal
        account. PayPal will also not charge fees for incoming transfers, <br />
        The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency
        services, such as central bank digital currencies, to boost its digital
        footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its own
        stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer
        found evidence of such a stablecoin within the source code of the
        company's iPhone app. <br />

        Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an incentive for
        those declaring crypto for tax purposes
      </h1>

        Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax
        starting in 2023, according to a new budget that won parliamentary
        approval on Thursday. <br /> <br />
        Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which
        was completed in a rush before the end of the year – features 21 billion
        euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and households
        facing the energy crisis, Reuters reported. <br /> <br />
        Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a capital-gains
        tax on crypto comes ahead of the implementation of the European Union's
        Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation that promises a licensing
        frameworks and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service
        providers <br /> <br />
        in the 27-member bloc. The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading
        if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive for declaring
        crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for
        investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023,
        instead of the cost at the time of purchase. According to the new rules,
        losses from crypto investments can be deducted from profits and be
        carried forward. <br /> <br />
        Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what
        qualifies as a taxable event as the document also says, "the exchange
        between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions,"
        doesn't constitute a "fiscal case." <br /> <br />

        Bitcoin miners' revenue dropped in 2022
      </h1>
      <img src={news3} className='articles--image' />
      <p className='articles--description'>
        Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a
        downward spiral alongside other cryptocurrencies. The falling
        cryptocurrency prices had a major effect on the income and profits of
        miners. Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue in 2022 seems like a
        large number, it is comparatively lower than that of 2021. <br /> <br />
        Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more than $15 billion in
        revenue, according to the data from the block. This was actually
        considered to be a 206% year-over-year increase.

        Microstrategy Buys More Bitcoin — Company's Crypto Holdings Grow to
        132,500 BTC
      </h1>
      <img src={news4} className='articles--image' />
      <p className='articles--description'>
        Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following its
        most recent purchases. This year, the world's largest cryptocurrency has
        emerged as 'the institutional-grade digital asset, said Microstrategy
        founder Michael Saylor. <br /> <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className='subheadings'>
          Microstrategy Acquires More Bitcoin
        </h1>{' '}
        <br /> <br />
        Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has
        purchased more bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor, the
        company's founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday: <br />{' '}
        <br />
        Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 BTC. As of
        12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03
        billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin. <br /> <br />
        In its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
        Microstrategy clarified that the 2,500 coins were acquired between Nov.
        1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy. <br />{' '}
        <br />
        The subsidiary bought approximately 2,395 BTC at an average price of
        $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 BTC
        at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more
        BTC at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is
        trading at $16,656.80. <br /> <br />
        The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold
        its bitcoin since it began accumulating the crypto for its corporate
        treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling BTC.
        ‘Microstrategy plans to carry back the capital losses resulting from
        this transaction against previous capital gains, to the extent such
        carrybacks are available under the federal income tax laws currently in
        effect, which may generate a tax benefit,’ the SEC filing describes.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h1 className='subheadings'>
          Saylor said in an interview last week: <br />
          The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the
          institutional grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is one
          crypto asset that’s a digital commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.
        </h1>{' '}
        <br /> <br />
        The executive noted that both the chairman of the SEC and the chair of
        the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that
        bitcoin is a commodity. Saylor previously explained that Microstrategy
        is investing in BTC ‘for the long term.’ He added: ‘Our strategy is to
        buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I expect
        bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So, we’re very patient. We
        think it’s the future of money.’

        Bitcoin Miners' Revenue Hits $9.55 Billion in 2022
      </h1>

        The investor drained $110 million in cryptocurrencies from the platform.{' '}
        <br /> <br />
        Avraham Eisenberg, the crypto investor whose ‘highly profitable trading
        strategy’ drained DeFi trading platform Mango Markets of crypto worth
        $110 million, was arrested Monday in Puerto Rico, court documents said.{' '}
        <br /> <br />
        The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango
        Markets’ treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now
        be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating
        a decentralized-finance trading platform. Eisenberg faces charges of
        commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a filing
        unsealed Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines
        to prison time. A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz
        alleges Eisenberg ‘willfully and knowingly’ manipulated the sale of a
        commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets. ‘Eisenberg
        engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial
        manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a
        cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and
        deceptive devices and contrivances.’
